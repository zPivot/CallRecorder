# Call Recorder for Android

This Android application allows you to record all incoming and outgoing calls from your phone. All your recorded calls are saved in 3gp files and can be sent from the application.

You can enable/disable the recording during the call, or leave it enabled to record all the calls.

The main application screen contains a list of all calls with details of phone numbers, date and time of a call.
Selecting one of the items will provide you with 3 options: play, send, and erase.

In order to enable or disable recording, select enable/disable recording from the menu.

Your audio files are stored on internal storage, although this can be changed from the settings.

The recording does not have a limit of time so be careful not to run out of space after a few long calls.

Compatible with Android 2.2 (API 8) or above

Tested on Android 4.1.2, 4.2.2, 4.4.2, and 5.1.1.

Some devices with Android 4.4.2 and Android 5+ are not able to start recording

Note: For some reason Android will not properly clean references to MediaRecorder, that will stop the application to use MediaRecorder again until phone is rebooted.
